# User Management System
An application that manages user accounts and provides statistical analysis.

## Features:
- Add new users with username, email, and age
- Update user email addresses
- Deactivate user accounts
- Calculate average age of active users
- Categorize users into age groups (youth: 0-17, adult: 18-64, senior: 65+)
- Prevent duplicate usernames
- Validate age range (0-150)

The system should maintain a collection of users, allow modifications to user data, and provide accurate statistics on active users only.
